**Learn to build decentralized applications on popular blockchain technologies using Rust**

## What is this book about?
This book helps you build your own blockchains and production-grade decentralized apps on blockchains like Ethereum, Solana, NEAR, and Polkadot. Youâ€™ll explore best practices, code, and assets that can be used for scaffolding multiple projects.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand essential Rust concepts required to build blockchain
* Apply blockchain features such as nodes and p2 communication using Rust
* Understand and implement consensus in blockchain
* Build and deploy a dApp on Ethereum with the Foundry framework in Rust
* Develop and deploy a dApp on Solana and the NEAR protocol
* Build a custom blockchain using the Substrate framework by Polkadot

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
pub struct Block {
    timestamp: i64,
    pre_block_hash: String,
    hash: String,
    transactions: Vec<Transaction>,
    nonce: i64,
    height: usize,
}
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This Rust programming book is for blockchain developers interested in building dApps on popular blockchains using Rust. Blockchain architects wanting to save time required to go through documentation and understand each technology can also use this book as a quick-start guide. Experience in building applications on blockchain is required, and familiarity with Rust will be helpful but not necessary.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
## Software and Hardware List
| Chapter | Software required | OS required |
| -------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| 1-11 | Rust 1.74.0 or higher | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
| 1-11 | Cargo | Windows, macOS, or Linux |
